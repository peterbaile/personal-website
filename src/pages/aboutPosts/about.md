Hi, I am Peter, a sophomore studying [NETS](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I was born in Changzhou, China (the same place where the famous Chinese Mathematician Hua Luogeng was born) and lived in Shanghai for 14 years before my family moved to Hong Kong.

During my childhood, I spent most of my time helping my parents with their software retailing company and often went to the PC-assembling shops next door to only break things and later be scolded by my parents. Nonetheless, looking at customers coming to our little shop and always purchasing Microsoft Windows/ Office and chips from Intel made me realize the brand power of these tech companies. At that time, I thought make products that a lot of people are using is cool. So I went on dreaming about myself establishing such a successful company.

It took me a while to realize the goal of building tech is beyond merely being cool. By the time I was 8, Steve Job's announcement of the first iPhone made me understand that tech can also be something that is impactful, something that can be created to better this society. But this was only the start of me being amazed at what tech can achieve. Every now and then, there is the release of a new product that keeps me surprised: Google's search engine, Elon Musk's rockets and electric cars and later Amazon's AWS. From then on, I decided to create my own tech so that it can also benefit this society the same way these tech companies have done.

Therefore, I continue striving to better myself, to equip myself with more tools. I am now a full-stack web developer at Penn Labs (a student-run organization) and the Director of the Web Department of the Daily Pennsylvanian. Quality only comes after great experiences and experiences can only be accumulated with relentless efforts. I hope that sometime in the future, with my focus and knowledge, I am able to contribute to the next page of the tech industry.
