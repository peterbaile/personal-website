Hi, I am Peter, a sophomore studying [NETS](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

I was born in Changzhou, China and lived in Shanghai for 14 years before my family moved to Hong Kong.

I think as people we have passion for something, no matter small or large. And for me, that passion is to be a great entrepreneur.
